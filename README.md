# üé® Feature Transformation Playground

Welcome to the **Feature Transformation Playground** ‚Äì a hands-on, visual, and educational guide to mastering feature scaling and transformation techniques in data science and machine learning.

Whether you're new to preprocessing or refining your skills, this project will walk you through **Standardization**, **Robust Scaling**, and various **Gaussianizing transformations** using real-world data, visuals, and detailed markdown explanations.

## üìÅ Repository Overview

This project is organized into standalone Jupyter notebooks:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1. StandardScaler and Normalization.ipynb
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2. Robust transformation.ipynb
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 3. Gaussian transformation.ipynb
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .ipynb_checkpoints/
```

- üìò **StandardScaler and Normalization**  
  Apply Z-score standardization and Min-Max normalization, with before/after plots and explanations.

- üìô **Robust Transformation**  
  Explore outlier-resistant scaling methods like `RobustScaler`.

- üìó **Gaussian Transformation**  
  Dive into Log, Box-Cox, Yeo-Johnson, Quantile, and Power transformations to make features more normal-like.

## üí° Best Practices Cheat Sheet

| Situation | Recommended Transformer |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Feature with outliers | `RobustScaler` |
| Feature needs zero mean, unit variance | `StandardScaler` |
| Features must be bounded (e.g., neural nets) | `MinMaxScaler` |
| Skewed distribution | Log / Box-Cox / Quantile Transformer |

‚ö†Ô∏è Don‚Äôt forget to **fit transformers only on training data** to avoid data leakage!
